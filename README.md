# AlphaMC
#### written by XtremePlayzCODE and daniktheboss

AlphaMC is a fast Minecraft: Pocket Edition server software, like [XPocket](https://github.com/XPocket/XPocket), but in Python.

## Why python?
Python is fast, and helps alot when making stuff. We might make a GUI using Tkinter, but that is yet to be determined.

## Release date?
Umm, were not sure. Watch the repo to see when we are done.
